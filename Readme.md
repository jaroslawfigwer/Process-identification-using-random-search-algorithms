# Process identification using random search algorithms

## Overview

This is a piece of software being an exemplary multiprocessor implementation of an identification algorithm described in section 2.3 of the book "Process identification using random search algorithms in examples" (in Polish). This algorithm utilizes simple random search ideas aided by a local optimisation to identify a model of a static plant. It can be used, after changing a definition of model output calculation and source of data, to identify all models of time-series and input-output plants described in the mentioned book.

## Build example

To run the example run:

``./run.sh``
